# Overview

A Discord bot written using Discord.py, requires at least Python 3.13 to work.

BOKBot is a self-hosted bot designed for use in one guild at a time. Future expansion for support
of several guilds at a time is planned for the future.

You are welcome to copy and modify the code to suit your needs, **please just link back to BOKBot as the 
original source, or use the Fork tool.** 

Feel free to check out the Wiki section to see how to get started with using BOKBot
for your own purposes (WIP).

### NOTICE: BOKBot is currently in the process of a massive rework of internal systems.
